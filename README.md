Here's a link to the deployment. https://8-hour-challenge.vercel.app/

My next goals for this project are as follows:

mobile experience

full responsiveness

play button queries a microservice, and pulls up a video stream

possible elastic transcoder integration

To run the app, clone the repository. Be sure to install gatsby-cli.

Contact the creator for some test data.

```
npm install
gatsby develop
